# FT_PRINTF

## Project Overview

In this project, the objective was to create a library containing a function that mimics the behavior of the `printf()` function without implementing its buffer management. The function is designed to handle various conversions: c, s, p, d, i, u, x, X, and %. This project served as an introduction to variadic functions in C.

The project has successfully passed both personal testing and the francinette --strict tests.

## Makefile Rules

- `all`: Build the project.
